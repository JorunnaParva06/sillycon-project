## Sillycon Valley Hackathon hosted by UAIS

Idea: Use Supervised Learning to train an AI to Determine the Probability of a Message being Flirtatious

Input: A message (sentence)
Output: % chance that the message is flirtatious

The dataset we used (which is admittedly terrible) contains polarization (0 - no flirtation, 1 - flirtation) and the final_message that was sent

**To run this program:**
  1. Download the files from this repository
  2. Make sure you have Streamlit and all necessary packages installed (pandas, scikit-learn)
  3. Run main.py
  4. Copy the Streamlit command from the terminal, it should look something like "streamlit run c:/path/to/main.py [ARGUMENTS]"
  5. Paste the command back into the terminal. It should then open a tab in your internet browser.
  6. Have fun!
