Sillycon Valley Hackathon hosted by UAIS

Idea: Use Supervised Learning to train an AI to Determine the Probability of a Message being Flirtatious

Input: A message (sentence)
Output: % chance that the message is flirtatious

The dataset we used (which is admittedly terrible) contains polarization (0 - no flirtation, 1 - flirtation) and the final_message that was sent
